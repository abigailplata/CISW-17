				Events are when something happens to the browser -- the user clicking a button, mouse pointer moving, or the web page loading from the server.
				The script that you use to detect and respond to an event is called an <em>event handler</em>.
				JavaScript uses a set of onjects to store information about the various parts of a web page-buttons, links, images, windows, etc.
				Each event is associated with an object and has a name. For instance, <strong>onMouseOver</strong> event occurs when the mouse pointer moves over an objecct on the page.
				When the pointer moves over a link, the event is sent to that link's event handler, if it has one.
				To define the event handler, you add it to that particular link's &#60;a&#62; HTML tag.
				An example of creating an event handler:</br></br>
				&#60;a href="http://www.google.com/"</br>
					onmouseover="alert('You move over the link.');"&#62;</br>
					This is a link.&#60; /a&#62; </br></br>
				Instead of specifying an event handler in an HTML document, you can use JavaScript to assign a function as an event handler. 
				This enables you to set event handlers conditionally, turn them on and off, and change the function that handles an event dynamically.
				Now, waht if you want more than one thing to happen whenyou click on an element? 
				Suppose you want two functions called <strong>update</strong> and <strong>display</strong> to bothe execute when a button is clicked.
				One solution is to define a function that calls both functions. The W3C DOM standard defines a function, <strong>addEventListener</strong>, for this purpose.

				Now, learning about some of the most useful objects in the DOM-browser windows and frames-and how JavaScripts can interact with them.
				Previously we learned that we can use DOM objects to represent various parts of the browser window and the current HTML document.
				In addition, we learned that the <strong>histroy, document,</strong> and <stron>location</strong> onjects are all children of the <strong>window</strong> object.
				The <strong>window</strong> object always refers to the current window (the one containing the script). 
				Although there is normally a single <strong>window</strong> object, there might be more than one if you are using pop-up windows or frames.
				Each window objects has the following properties:</br>
				<ul>
					<li> window.closed </li>
					<li> window.defaultstatus and window.status </li>
					<li> window.frames[] </li>
					<li> window.name</li>
					<li> window.opener</li>
					<li> window.parent</li>
					<li> window.screen</li>
					<li>window.self</li>
					<li>window.top</li>
				</ul> </br>
				One of the most convenient uses for the window object is to create a new window.
				You can create a new browser window with the window.open() method.

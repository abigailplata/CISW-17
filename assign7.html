				Events are when something happens to the browser -- the user clicking a button, mouse pointer moving, or the web page loading from the server.
				The script that you use to detect and respond to an event is called an <em>event handler</em>.
				JavaScript uses a set of onjects to store information about the various parts of a web page-buttons, links, images, windows, etc.
				Each event is associated with an object and has a name. For instance, <strong>onMouseOver</strong> event occurs when the mouse pointer moves over an objecct on the page.
				When the pointer moves over a link, the event is sent to that link's event handler, if it has one.
				To define the event handler, you add it to that particular link's &#60;a&#62; HTML tag.
				An example of creating an event handler:</br>
				<strong> &#60;a href="http://www.google.com/"</br>
					onmouseover="alert('You move over the link.');"&#62;</br>
					This is a link.&#60; /a&#62; </strong>

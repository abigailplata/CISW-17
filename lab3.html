		<h1> Summary of JavaScript </h1>

		<h2> History of JavaScript and What It Can Do </h2>
		<p>
			When in need of making an interactive tasks it will require a sophisticated, scripting language like Javascript.
			HTML is a simple text markup language that can't respond to the user, make decisions, or automate repetitive tasks. 
			A scripting language enables you to combine scripting with HTML to create interactive web pages.
			Javascript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, the same maker of the Netscape web browser. 
			It was the first web scripting language supported by browsers, and it is still one of the most popular. 
			It can: Display Messages to the user in the status line or in alert boxes, Validate the contents of a form and make calculations,
			animate images, create ad banners, detect the browser in use or its features and perform advanced functions, detect plug-ins, 
			modify a part of the webpage without reloading, and display or interact with data retrieved from the remote server.
		</p>

		<h2> Where JavaScript Code Can Be Inserted</h2>
		<p> 
			Using the script tag will help you add a short script into a web document. It tells the browser to treat the text as script until the closing tag.
			In the header scripts cant create output within the HTML document, but can be referred to by other scripts. The header is mostly used for functions.
			Within a HTML tag it is referred as an event handler and enables the script to work with HTML elements. Lastly, it can be in a seperate file entirley with .js as the extension.
			When using an entirley seperate file for JavaScript all you need is one line of code to refer to that document. 
		</p>

		<h2> JavaScript Capabilities</h2>
		<p>
			JavaScript can make a webpage a lot more efficient with its capabilities. One of them is being able to create a navigation 
			tool like a drop down menu or a submenu that pops up when you hover over it. Form validation is another use of JavaScript. A
			script can read values and make sure it's the right format like ZIP codes or phone numbers. Next are special effects like draggable objects and creating fading transitions between images.
			The scripts can  also gather data from a server known as Asyncrnchronous JavaScript and XML or remote scripting. AJAX is in use when using Gmail or Yahooo! Mail. It can also display time and the date and calculate results. 
		</p>

		<h2> Creating and Testing JavaScript </h2>
		<p>  
			To create output JavaScript includes various ways to display information like using document.write statement. Document.write statement displays a text string, a number, or anything you give it. 
			To test your script you just need to load the HTML document that was created in the web browser. If everything was typed out correctly the code will run and the browser will display the result. With time
			the writer will encounter errors with compiling the code and usually it is syntax related. Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer have a JavaScript Console or some sort of debugging box to help find the errors.

			var today = new Date();
			
			var date = 'Time Last Opened: '+today.getFullYear()+'-'+(today.getMonth()+1)+'-'+today.getDate();
			
			var time = today.getHours() + ":" + today.getMinutes() + ":" + today.getSeconds()+' PST';
			
			var dateTime = date+' '+time;
			
			document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = dateTime;
			
			d = new Date();
			localTime = d.getTime();
			localOffset = d.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000;
			UTC = localTime + localOffset;
			offset = (-4);
			newyork = UTC + (3600000*offset);
			nd = new Date(newyork);
			document.writeln("New York Time: " + nd.toLocaleString() + "<br>");

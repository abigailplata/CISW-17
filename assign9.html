		<h2> Chapter 23</h2>
			<p>
				In this chapter we will learn about Greasemonkey, a Firefox extension that enables to write scriots to modify the appearance and behavior of sites visited.
				With the right add-ons User scripts can also work in Internet Exlporer, Opera, and Safari. Chrome has native support for user scripts.
				User scripts can: change the appearance of one or more sites - colors, font, etc, change the behavior of one or more sites with JavaScript, fix a bug in a site before the author does, and add a feature to your browser, such as text macros.
				Greasemonkey scripts can range from simple ones such as Linkify to complex scripts that add a feature to the browser, rearrange a site to make it more usable, or eliminate annoying features like pop-up ads.
				Don't install a script unless you understand what it's doing. Even though Greasemonkey developers have spent a lot of time eliminating security hoels, it is possible for a malicious script to cause trouble.
				You can create a user script that changes the text and background colors of paragraphs in sites you visit. Greasemonkey
				supports metadata at the beginning of your script. Use this feature to enclose your comments.The metadata section can obtain any of the following directives.
				Debugging a user script is much like debugging a regular JavaScript program - errors are displayed in the JavaScript Console in Firefox or in an error message.

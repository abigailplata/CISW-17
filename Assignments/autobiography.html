		<h2> Family </h2>
			<p> My parents are both latinos. My mother is from El Salvador and came to the United States in the 80's when she was 14. 
				My father is from Mexico and came to the U.S. in 70's at the age of 2. They met at their university where they fell in love and 
				had my sister and I years later. My sister is four years younger than me but very much a best friend. 
			</p>
		<h2> Friends </h2>
			<p>
				My friends are beautiful and colorful. I have a few from highschool in Los Angeles and many I met at my time at UC Merced and after.
				My best friend, Julissa is from Hayward, California and I met her at a part time parking lot job at UCM. She is
				working towards acing the bar exam.	Another best friend is Sam who is originally from the Philipines and 
				came when she was 14 like my mother. I met her at UCM and now get to visit her in San Diego from time to time
				when we're free. 
			</p>
		<h2> Education </h2>
			<p>
				I graduated from the University of California, Merced last May in 2020 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Engineering.
				I have since been looking for a career in the CS field while also practicing my skills on personal projects and 
				working towards a Web Development certificate at Mt. Sac. 
			</p>
		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
			<p>
				On my free time I love to work on my FR-s, gardening, or doing a physical activity like hiking, skating, or even just working out for a couple hours out of the day.

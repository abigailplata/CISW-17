			A fixed layout is just that, a layout in which the body of the page is set a specific width. 
			The width is controlled by a master "wrapper". 
			When creating a fixed-width layout, the most important decision is determining
			the minimum screen resolution you want to accomodate. 
			A liquid layout, also known as a fluid layout, is one in which the body of the page does not
			use a specified width in pixels. 
			The idea behind a liquid layout is that it can be perfectly usable and still 
			retain the overall design aesthetic even if the user has a very small screen. 
			The liquid layout appraoch might seem like the best approach at first. 
			Too much content can be overwhelming; not enough content in an open space is underwhelming.
			There is also the option for creating a fixed/liquid hybrid layout in which the HTML and CSS all validate properly.

				The term dynamic means active or something that motivates another to become active.
				A dynamic website is one that incorporates interactivity into its functionallity and design, but also motivates a user to take an action.
				For example, read more, purchase a product, etc. In this chapter we learn the different types of interactivity that make a site dynamic.
				In web development there are two different scripting: server-side and cliennt-side.
				You can use Javascript to display something different each time a page is loaded. Like displaying quotes.
				The quotes are loaded into an array, Javascript used to pluck out a quote randomly.
				Client-sid einteractivity using Javascript typically takes the form of manipulating the DOM in some way.
				The DOM is invisible structure of all documents.

			In this chapter we will be learning specific JavaScipt functions and features in greater depth.
			Statements, for starters, are the basic units of a Javascript program. 
			A statement is a section of code that performs a single action.
			Functions provide a simple way to handle a task, such as adding output to a webpage.
			Functions take parameters to tell them what to do. In addition, a functionall
			can return a value to a waiting variable. 
			Variables are an integer, string of text, or another value. 
			Javascript also supports objects. Objects, like variables, can store data, but they can store two or more pieces of data at once. 
			Sometimes as a developer you'll want to create a conditional statements like IF (2+2)==4: print True. 
			Then come loops like for loops and while loops that permform repetive tasks base on a condition.

				In this chapter we will better understand the Document Object Model (DOM), which is framework that properties and mehtod of Javascript explitly control so that you may develop rich user experiences.
				To work with the browser and documents, JavaScript uses a hierarchy of parent and child objects called the DOM.
				These objects are organized into a tree-like structure and represent all the content and components of a web document.
				The objects in the DOM have properties and methods.
				When you refer to an object, you use the parent object name followed by the child object name.
				The window object is the parent object for all the objects we will be looking at in this chpater. 
				The document object represents a web document or page. Web documents are displayed within the browser windows,
				so it shouldn't surprise you to learn that the document object is a child of the window object.
				You can get information about the document by writing: document.URL, document.title, document.cookie, document.images.
				Anchor child of the document object is the link object. There can be multiple link objects in a document. Each one includes
				information about a link to another location or an anchor.

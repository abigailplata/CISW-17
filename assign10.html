				It is possible to specifically design and offer print friendly versions of your pages for users who want to print a copy for offline reading.
				Similar to Google Maps. CSS makes it easy to create pages that will change appearance based on how they are viewed.
				Some web pages are print=friendly already. Pages with dark backgrounds, dynamic links, and several images might prove to be unwiedly for the 
				average printer. A printed page is typically 8 and 1/2 by 11 inches, whereas a screen can vary.
				Things to consider to make a page printer friednly is:
				remove the background of the page, change text color to black, font size large enough to read, remove link formatting, remove any and nonessential images.
				Luckily, CSS supports the concept of media-specific style sheets, which are style sheets that target a particular medium.
				The most interesting is aural type, which allows for web pages that can be read aloud or otherwise listened too.

				Working with web based forms. Web forms enable you to receive feedback, orders, or other information.
				When searching on Google that is a HTML web form - those single field entry forms with one button that, when pressed, give you all the information you are looking for.
				HTML form is a parrt of a web page that includes areas where users can enter information to be sent back to you, sent to another email, sent to a databse, or sent to another system altogether.
				Forms include a button for the user to submit the form. When someone clicks a form submission button, all the information typed in the form is sent to the URL that you specify in the action attribute.
				Every form must begin with a form tag, which can be located anywhere in the body of the HTML document. 
				The action attribute specifies the address to which to send the form data.
				Each form in your HTML page is represented in JavaScript by a form object, which has the same name as the name attribute in the form tag.
				To ask the user for a specific piece of information within a form, use the input tag.

				It is possible to specifically design and offer print friendly versions of your pages for users who want to print a copy for offline reading.
				Similar to Google Maps. CSS makes it easy to create pages that will change appearance based on how they are viewed.
				Some web pages are print=friendly already. Pages with dark backgrounds, dynamic links, and several images might prove to be unwiedly for the 
				average printer. A printed page is typically 8 and 1/2 by 11 inches, whereas a screen can vary.
				Things to consider to make a page printer friednly is:
				remove the background of the page, change text color to black, font size large enough to read, remove link formatting, remove any and nonessential images.
				Luckily, CSS supports the concept of media-specific style sheets, which are style sheets that target a particular medium.
				The most interesting is aural type, which allows for web pages that can be read aloud or otherwise listened too.

			<p>
			A fixed layout is just that, a layout in which the body of the page is set a specific width. 
			The width is controlled by a master "wrapper". 
			When creating a fixed-width layout, the most important decision is determining
			the minimum screen resolution you want to accomodate. 
			A liquid layout, also known as a fluid layout, is one in which the body of the page does not
			use a specified width in pixels. 
			The idea behind a liquid layout is that it can be perfectly usable and still 
			retain the overall design aesthetic even if the user has a very small screen. 
			The liquid layout appraoch might seem like the best approach at first. 
			Too much content can be overwhelming; not enough content in an open space is underwhelming.
			There is also the option for creating a fixed/liquid hybrid layout in which the HTML and CSS all validate properly.

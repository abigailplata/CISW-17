		<h1> Chapter 13 Summary </h1>
			<p>
				The term dynamic means active or something that motivates another to become active.
				A dynamic website is one that incorporates interactivity into its functionallity and design, but also motivates a user to take an action.
				For example, read more, purchase a product, etc. In this chapter we learn the different types of interactivity that make a site dynamic.
				In web development there are two different scripting: server-side and cliennt-side.
				You can use Javascript to display something different each time a page is loaded. Like displaying quotes.
				The quotes are loaded into an array, Javascript used to pluck out a quote randomly.
				Client-sid einteractivity using Javascript typically takes the form of manipulating the DOM in some way.
				The DOM is invisible structure of all documents.

		<h2>Using Tables to Display Information </h2>
		<p>
			When displaying data sometimes it is a better way to present information.
			By using the &#60; table &#62; tag, and of course the closing &#60; &frasl; table &#62; tag, 
			can get the developer started on the skeleton of a table before adding borders, padding, colors, etc.
			The next thing would be to add the &#60; tr &#62;, which would create a table row  &#40; tr &#41;.
			If you want the table to have a border then you'll have to use the border attribute, 
			otherwise a bordersize of 0 will make the border invisible. Now, to create the individual cells,
			use the &#60; td &#62; tag which stands for table data. You can place the table information in between the 
			&#60; td &#62; &#60; &frasl; td &#62; tags. Each row in a table consists of at least one cell and multiple
			cells within a row form a column. The last general tag for a table is the &#60; th &#62; which indicates 
			that the cell is part of the heading of the table. Most browsers render the text in &#60; th &#62; cells
			as centered and bold. You can create as many cells as you wish, but each row should generally have the same
			number of columns as the other rows. An example of a general table&#58;
			<table> 
			<tr> <th>City</th> <th>County</th> <th>Population</th> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Bell</td> <td> Los Angeles </td> <td> 35,682 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Hayward</td> <td> Alameda </td> <td> 159,293 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Irvine</td> <td> Orange </td> <td> 273,157 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Atwater</td> <td> Merced </td> <td> 29,296 </td> </tr>
			</table>
			This is a table before adding any styles, but you can add any text styles in a table cell. However, styles or
			HTML tags do not carry over to other cells as well as tags outside of the table. When the table width isn't 
			specified, the size automatically expand to fit the data. As seen above. To control the size of the entire table, use width
			and/or height styles in the &#60; table &#62; tag. You can also control the size in individual cells. The width and height 
			can be specified in terms of pixels or percentages. Next, we can allign the text to the&#58; top, middle, bottom, text-top, text-bottom,
			and baseline (for text). Finally, we have spanning. Spanning is the process of forcing a cell to stretch across more than one
			row or column of a table. The colspan attribute causes a cell to span across multiple columns; rowspan is the same for rows.
			Tweaking tables goes further than just using style properties though.

		<h2> External and Internal Links</h2>
		<p> 
			At this point our webpages are pieces of content with no connection to eachother or anything. To turn it into real web content, you
			will need to connect it to the rest of the web--or at least to other pages within your site. When files are stored in the same location,
			you can link them to eachother by simply providing the name of the file in the href attribute of the &#60; a &#62; tag. After you have more 
			than a few pages, or when you you start to have an organization structure, you should put your files into folders whose names reflect the content.
			An example: &#60;a href="/cities/losangeles.html"&#62;Learn about the City of Los Angeles.&#60; /a&#62; This is a relative-root addresses in that
			they are relative addresses that lack the entire domain name, but are specifically relative to the document root. An absolute link is when it is 
			absolutely no doubt where the link should go because the whole URL is provided. A double dot in a link is a special comman that indicates the
			folder that contains the current folder (the parent folder). 
		</p>
		<p>
			The &#60; /a&#62; tag responsible for links gets its name from the word "anchor", which means the link serves as a designation for a 
			spot in the web page. The &#60; /a&#62; tag can be used to mark a spot on a page as an anchor, which helps you make links that points 
			to an exact point you want. For example: &#60;a id="top"&#62;&#60; /a&#62; The &#60; /a&#62; tag gives a name to the specific point 
			on the page where the tag occurs. The &#60;a href="#top"&#62; Return to Index.&#60; /a&#62; The # symbol means that the word top 
			refers to a named anchor point.

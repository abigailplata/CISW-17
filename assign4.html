		<h2>Using Tables to Display Information </h2>
		<p>
			When displaying data sometimes it is a better way to present information.
			By using the &#60; table &#62; tag, and of course the closing &#60; &frasl; table &#62; tag, 
			can get the developer started on the skeleton of a table before adding borders, padding, colors, etc.
			The next thing would be to add the &#60; tr &#62;, which would create a table row  &#40; tr &#41;.
			If you want the table to have a border then you'll have to use the border attribute, 
			otherwise a bordersize of 0 will make the border invisible. Now, to create the individual cells,
			use the &#60; td &#62; tag which stands for table data. You can place the table information in between the 
			&#60; td &#62; &#60; &frasl; td &#62; tags. Each row in a table consists of at least one cell and multiple
			cells within a row form a column. The last general tag for a table is the &#60; th &#62; which indicates 
			that the cell is part of the heading of the table. Most browsers render the text in &#60; th &#62; cells
			as centered and bold. You can create as many cells as you wish, but each row should generally have the same
			number of columns as the other rows. An example of a general table&#58;
			<table> 
			<tr> <th>City</th> <th>County</th> <th>Population</th> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Bell</td> <td> Los Angeles </td> <td> 35,682 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Hayward</td> <td> Alameda </td> <td> 159,293 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Irvine</td> <td> Orange </td> <td> 273,157 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td>Atwater</td> <td> Merced </td> <td> 29,296 </td> </tr>
			</table>
			This is a table before adding any styles, but you can add any text styles in a table cell. However, styles or
			HTML tags do not carry over to other cells as well as tags outside of the table. When the table width isn't 
			specified, the size automatically expand to fit the data. As seen above. To control the size of the entire table, use width
			and/or height styles in the &#60; table &#62; tag. You can also control the size in individual cells. The width and height 
			can be specified in terms of pixels or percentages. Next, we can allign the text to the&#58; top, middle, bottom, text-top, text-bottom,
			and baseline (for text). Finally, we have spanning. Spanning is the process of forcing a cell to stretch across more than one
			row or column of a table. The colspan attribute causes a cell to span across multiple columns; rowspan is the same for rows.
			Tweaking tables goes further than just using style properties though.

		<h2> External and Internal Links</h2>
		<p> 
			At this point our webpages are pieces of content with no connection to eachother or anything. To turn it into real web content, you
			will need to connect it to the rest of the web--or at least to other pages within your site. When files are stored in the same location,
			you can link them to eachother by simply providing the name of the file in the href attribute of the &#60; a &#62; tag. After you have more 
			than a few pages, or when you you start to have an organization structure, you should put your files into folders whose names reflect the content.
			An example: &#60;a href="/cities/losangeles.html"&#62;Learn about the City of Los Angeles.&#60; /a&#62; This is a relative-root addresses in that
			they are relative addresses that lack the entire domain name, but are specifically relative to the document root. An absolute link is when it is 
			absolutely no doubt where the link should go because the whole URL is provided. A double dot in a link is a special comman that indicates the
			folder that contains the current folder (the parent folder). 
		</p>
		<p>
			The &#60; /a&#62; tag responsible for links gets its name from the word "anchor", which means the link serves as a designation for a 
			spot in the web page. The &#60; /a&#62; tag can be used to mark a spot on a page as an anchor, which helps you make links that points 
			to an exact point you want. For example: &#60;a id="top"&#62;&#60; /a&#62; The &#60; /a&#62; tag gives a name to the specific point 
			on the page where the tag occurs. The &#60;a href="#top"&#62; Return to Index.&#60; /a&#62; The # symbol means that the word top 
			refers to a named anchor point. 
		</p>
		
		<p> <a href="#top"> Take me to the top! :)</a> </p>
		
		<p>
			Often times we will want to link multiple pages between our own web content. 
			When you make a link from one file to another within the same domain or on the same
			computer, you don't need to specify a complete Internet address. If the two files are
			in the same location it can simply be: &#60;a href="pagetwo.html"&#62; Go to second page.&#60; /a&#62;
			When linking to external web content the only difference is needing to include the full address.
			The full address will contain the http:// before the domain name, and the full pathname. In addition to linking 
			between pages and part of the web, the &#60; /a&#62; tag allows for linking to an email address.
			This is a useful and efficient way for visitors to communicate with you. An HTML link to an email address looks 
			like: &#60;a href="mailto:yourusername@yourdomain.com"&#62; Send me an email.&#60; /a&#62; A note when linking your
			webpage to your email is that spammers harvest email addresses by using programs that automatically search for mailto links.
			A trick to being incognito is using characters entities to encode your email address. As an example, jcmeloni@gmail.com, if you 
			replcae the letters in the address with their charactter entity equivalents, most programs will be thrown off.

		<h2>Colors, Images, and Multimedia</h2>
		<p>
			Best practices when choosing colors is to always keep in mind how you want to influence your visitors and make them feel. 
			Many websites choose blue tones, since blue is known to have calming effects unlike red. Consider your demographics, have a small color pallete (less is more),
			and natural palette of colors are generally reccommmended. Doesn't mean your colors are limited, instead just be mindful 
			when coloring your website. To specify a color as the background is simple by using style="background-color:blue" inside the body tag or in the style sheet.
			There are 16 colors like: aqua, black, teal, white, yellow, etc., 140 descriptive colors like: lavender, honeydew, bisque, dodgerblue, etc., and 16 million colors using
			hexadecimal color codes, #FF00FF for instance. Not all monitors will display colors in the same hues though. You can also change colors
			to texts, container elements, borders, and links.
		</p>
		<p>
			For graphics you can use any graphic program like Adobe to create and edit images. GIMP is a fully functional program 
			that is free and used to perform necessary actions. The resolution of an image is the number of pixels that make up an image. 
			Large high resolution images take longer to transfer and display than small, low resolution images. To place photos on your 
			web pages, you need to convert your print-based photos to digital images. Crop, resize, and edit images to your liking. 
			Images on the web work best when it is saved in the JPEG file. Graphics you create from scratch like banners and buttons, require you to make
			considerations different from photographs. You should generally plan your graphics so that they will always fit within smaller screens.

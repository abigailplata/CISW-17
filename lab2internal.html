		<h1> Summary of Chapter 3 </h1>

		<h2> 1. How CSS Works </h2>
		<p> CSS is a style sheet document that brings a clean diplay of the Web.
		It specifies the fonts, colors, spacing, and other characteristics that make a unique look for a website.
		There are two different style sheets, internal and external. Where an internal style sheet is placed directly
		within the website and the external style sheet is a different document and linked to a webpage via a tag.
		CSS determines the style rules according to a hierarchy which then establishes a cascading effect.
		</p>

		<h2> 2. Basic CSS  Layout Properties </h2>
		<p> Layout properties are used to determine how content is displayed on web page.
		An important property is the "diaplay", which tells the element how to be displayed.
		the display property has four possible values: block, list-item, inline, none.
		It is good to remember to visualize each element on a web page occupying a rectangular area.
		Another good tip is to try to be consistent with units of measurement.
		</p>

		<h2> 3. Basic CSS Formatting Properties</h2>
		<p> Formatting properties are used to control the appearance of content.
		The most used property is "border". The "color" property sets the color of the text
		in an element and the background-color property sets the background color behind the text.
		The writer can change the font, text-align, and adjust line height, along with much more.
		</p>

		<h2> 4. Using Style Classes and Style IDs </h2>
		<p> A style class is a custom set of formatting specifications that can be applied to any element in a web page.
		A CSS Style property is a specific style that can be assigned a value, such as a color or font size.
		A selector is used to identify tags on a page to which you apply styles. When referencing a style class
		in HTML, just specify the class name. Us e a div tag wherever you want to apply
		your custom tag. An example of a selector with an ID indicated, plus a property and value:
		p#title {font: 24pt Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sens-serif}
		When referencing a style ID in HTML, simply specify the ID name in the id attribute of an element. 
		</p>

			<p>
				Using third-party libraries to enable you to avoid reinventing the wheel for common tasks. 
				Third-party libraries are not included with JavaScript, but serve a similar purpose (enabling you to do complicated things with only small amount of code.)
				Prototype is a JavaScript library that simplifies tasks like working with DOM objects, dealing with data in forms, and AJAX.
				We used <b>document.getElementById</b> methos to obtain the DOM object previously.
				Prototype has an improved version of this in the $() function.
				Next is jQuery. This library is currently up to version 1.6.2 and now has an additional advanced user interface extensions library that can be used alongside existing libraries to rapidly build and deploy rich user interfaces.
				jQuery has at its heart a sophisticated, cross-browser method for selection of page elements.
				Script.aculo.us includes functions to simplify drag-and-drop tasks, such as rearranging lists of items.
				Additionally it includes a number of combination effects, which enables high-lighting and animated transitions within pages.
				AJAX (Asynchrounous JavaScript and XML), enables JavaScript to communicate with a program running on the web server. 
				This allows JavaScript to do things that were traditionally not possible, such as dynamically loading information from a database or storing data on a server without refreshing a page.
				AJAX requires complex scripting, because the methods used to communicate with the server may vary depending on the browser.

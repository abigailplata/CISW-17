CHAPTER 2: Understanding HTML and XHTML Connections
Explaining the various elements that must appear in an HTML file so that it is 
displayed appropriately in your web browser.
A web page is just a text file that is marked up by HTML codes that tell the browser
how to display the text. 
To create these text files use a text editor such as Notepad or Textedit.
.html
every web page you create must include:
<html></html>
<head></head>
<title></title>
<body></body>
< these are coded commands >
XHTML is a more structured version of HTML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> meands its XHTML
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN”
“http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd”>
<p></p> line break when it ends
<br/> forces a lne break
<hr/> horizontal rule line causing a line break
<title> gives the entire oage an identifying name that isnt displayed on the page itself;
its displayed on the browsers title bar
heading tags on the other hand cause some text on the page to be displayed w visual emphasis
do not use headings as a way to achieve a particular look beccause thats what CSS is for
validating your web content:
validating is the process of testing your pages w a special app that searches for errors
and makes sure your pages follow the strict XHTML standard.
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) -- offers an online validation tool you can use
http://validator.w3.org/
The problem with disorder in HTML is that it
results in web browsers having to guess at how a page is to be displayed,
which is not a good thing.
you
could create your own version of HTML using XML
The point is that XML lays the
ground rules for organizing information in a consistent manner, and that
information can be anything from web pages to bottle caps
The new XML-compliant version of HTML is known as XHTML
You might have heard about HTML5, which is touted as the next web standard. It will be, but not quite yet. When it does become a web standard, it
will not render XHTML useless—HTML5 is not a replacement for XHTML,
but instead is a major revision of HTML 4.
The goal of this book is to guide you through the basics of web publishing,
using XHTML and CSS as the core languages of those pages
